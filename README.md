# DMV Exchange in Google's Go language

Experimental project to test the improvements of using Golang instead of Nodejs for marketplace backend

Probably the most modern programming language designed to handle multiple cores & cpus

Decided to port DMV Exchange as an attempt to keep server maintainence costs as low as possible & increasing maximum
server load
